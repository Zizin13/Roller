## Remaining issues:
- TRACK1: right wall at the end of final tunnel is shaped wrong (483-486)
- TRACK4: light green outer walls - bit 31? (217-241)
- TRACK5: light green outer walls right before start/finish, roofs before jump (363-366, 81, 87, 93, 99)
- TRACK9: buildings clip into track in tunnel (137)
- TRACK12: wall geometry wrong (106-107)
- TRACK13: building floating over roof (428-431)
- TRACK15: pits have grass, texture pair should work backwards somehow instead of forwards (1-46)
- TRACK16: floating tree (203)
- TRACK20: has the green walls too
- TRACK22: end of tunnel walls are gone facing backwards (335)
- TRACK24: moving pothole animates too quickly (27)
- create separate model for transparent track sections to be drawn last
- outer floor at ends of corkscrews
- z fighting is annoying
- mission car lacks pink color changing
- polygons have four bytes of data that do something unknown
- "places" arrays are unknown
- find a way to embed additional information in FBX export such as AI data and surface grip (is this possible?)
- support stunt animation in FBX export
- support wheel texture animation in FBX export
